###21/12/2016 Mumming in Jericho###
It was an unseasonably balmy night in December and the streets of Jericho were abuzz with festive bustle. It was time for the return of the Mummers' ancient yarn of death, rebirth and non-sanctioned medical procedures. On the longest night of the year, the beloved figures of Father Christmas (be he welcome or be he welcome not) and the President-Elect (sorry, wrong character!) would put on their costumes, recite lines passed down generations and hope against hope that, with this help, the seasons would again turn, the day lengthen, and warmth and joy be restored for yet another year. That the uninformed observer might have mistaken this for a ragtag of inebriated pensioners in cheap fancy dress only testifies to the dreadful disrespect for tradition in these troubled times.  
Many Christmas folk plays have been recorded across the country, from oral traditions, from ancient documents stored in the Bodleian library, from, in our case, a venerable Word file. It is a simple tale. Saint George challenges the Turkish Knight to a swordfight, and makes short work of him. A Doctor of great renown revives the unfortunate by dental means, only for St George to fell him again and Beelzebub to drag him off shoulderborne. Father Christmas, Jack Finney, the Parson's Nose and the Little Old Lady appear, at various times, to provide narrative framing, musical entertainment, postmodernist comic relief, and a horse. These plots, typical of the Cotswold and Southern English regions, harken to an ancient narrative of crop cycles, natural rhythms and dearth of genuinely funny entertainment. It has been in the spirit of this tradition that, for many Christmases, Oxford City Morris Men have performed their play at the Rose and Crown, basking in the cheer of an ever delighted audience or, possibly, Andrew's free beer. This year would be no different. The cast members were to meet for a first performance at the Gardener's Arms (**not** the one in Plantation Road George!) and then proceed along North Parade. So it was with some apprehension that the Mummers tallied their number and came up a Father Christmas, a Turkish Knight and a Doctor short.  
There's really no point getting worried when one has beer and a flexible concept of punctuality. And so it happened that the Doctor, having circumcycled Jericho and most of Summertown and repeatedly missed North Parade on either end, eventually showed up armed with stethoscope, leech, plunger, and a Large Wolf's Tooth. Then Duncan could play the Turkish Knight, as he'd done the Saturday before in a last-minute £2.99 costume from the British Heart Foundation. Now only Father Christmas was missing, with all his gear. What to do? With a suitable disguise, the Little Old Lady could double as an unusually fancy Father Christmas - but there was no disguise. Dick was close enough to character already that a red hat nabbed from a festive passerby could have done as a costume, but then someone would have had to whisper the lines at him very loudly. The Mummers dithered, and then Bob, the original Turkish Knight, made it into the pub - having also repeatedly missed North Parade on either end, but on a motorcycle. Duncan as Father Christmas then? But he didn't know the lines and had no kit. Dawn? But who would then take care of the horse? Morris time is not strict, but after half an hour of increasingly fretful dilly-dallying, it was uncomfortably close to getting, in fact, a bit late. It was then that George, dragging a suitcase larger than himself, triumphantly appeared at the door of the (correct) Gardener's Arms.  
The Mummers breathed a sigh of relief. The play could start, after all! Swords were readied in their sheaths and blinking hats donned. But even as Father Christmas was pleading the audience's attention, a new, darker threat was rising. A maddened, cruel or terminally tone-deaf organiser had scheduled a plague of fifty ukuleles to descend onto the Jericho Christmas street fair. These were led by the sort of man who would willingly inflict such suffering on unsuspecting civilians - rude, angry, twisted by the dissonant chords of the little instruments of torture burrowing into his soul. This despicable man attempted to halt the play by intercepting the Doctor mid-swordfight and demanding the stage for his ukulele army - with the ridiculous claim that the Mummers were late and had thus overrun into his slot. As the Doctor is also the Logkeeper, this only earned him a particularly unflattering depiction in this selfsame report. While the play proceeded, however, the miniature musical manglers had assembled into attack formation across North Parade and proceeded to plink through every Christmas song known to man (as long as it involves no more than two easy chords).  
By this point the Doctor/Logkeeper was in the throes of advanced hypochondria and her recollection of the evening is hazy, filtered as it was through an uncharacteristic curtain of sobriety. Duncan had to take up the Doctor's scrubs for the next two performances, in North Parade and the Rose and Crown; much charity money was collected, free beer consumed, songs sung, cheer spread, and with the ritual reenactment of the ageless cycle of life, death and rebirth, the relentlessly decreasing declination of the sun was, once again, reversed. And so the night ended and the Mummers dispersed, each carrying the warm glow of another year's success in astronomical nudging, or a giant shield, or a frying pan, or a horse.  


###03/11/2016 AGM###
The AGM saw the positions of power remain clutched in the hands of the well-established incumbents. Any opposition to the current state of affairs appears to have taken the form of an extremely patient war of attrition, presumably relying on the inevitable heat death of the Universe to deal the final blow. The Bagman was heard to encourage political assassination, possibly out of exasperation. Ian Wheeler attempted to deflect any calls to official duty with flattery and misdirection, and was entirely successful.  
The financial position of the side appears to be roughly in line with its age and status, in that we appear to have more money than we have the energy to spend. Given the Bagman's peculiar disinclination to spend other people's money, we must assume he's slowly saving it up to renationalise the railways. Admittedly a large portion of the sum is still represented by the side's share of payment for the 'Stealing Sheep' video which, while successful and financially rewarding, has not propelled the side to national stardom and viral notoriety as generally expected, and therefore is unlikely to herald a future of multi-billion reality TV deals.  
Upon Chris Price's querying, it was found that the Policy on Hats has evolved further from last year's position - that the Policy on Hats is that we have no Policy on Hats - to an unwritten, unspoken but nonetheless strictly enforced Policy on Hats. General opprobrium and other assorted misfortunes are thought to await transgressors. Although it may be unadvisable (possibly treason) to discuss it further, it can probably be said that Policy on Hats means Policy on Hats, and we will make a success of it.  
Among the AOB, the issue of ISO9000 certification documentation was raised, with some difficulty as it is understood to be a tome of considerable heft. George volunteered to organise a stick-making workshop event and possibly extend the invitation to other sides who might be interested: while very high in nebulosity, the proposal has already attracted the worried attention of the Forestry Commission.  
After a swift conclusion to the official business, the cheese and beer were descended upon with plague-like voracity and consumed, with the exception of Adrian's forlorn vegan hummus and Chris's cucumbers and tangerines. These were acquired at 11 and 22 for one pound respectively; yielding a cucumber : tangerine ratio particularly well suited to rude visual puns, which were duly arranged. Far more tangerines had disappeared by the end of the night than had been eaten; it is thought that the pupils at St Barnabas' will keep finding the odd tangerine in their gym equipment, socks, bathrooms and rafters for years to come.


###23/09/2016 Maggie's Culture Crawl###
Did this event happen? Did we participate? This is a mystery that even I, the Logkeeper, cannot unravel. An email may or may not have circulated in which this charity event was mooted, but simultaneously dismissed as unfeasible. Before being effectively put on it, the event was dropped from the calendar, only to be reinstated at the following practice when enough people for a side appeared to be available and keen.   However, this plan also failed to transpire: on the night, Mark Fry suffered a vehicular mishap and thus it was only five of us who could join a similarly-sized group of Wolvercote dancers in the Castle courtyard to bewilder charity walkers. Furthermore, due to the almost complete darkness in which the event took place (if it did), there is no eyewitness testimony that any dancing indeed happened (the dancers themselves were later found drunken in the Blenheim, and are therefore not considered reliable evidence).  
If dancing did occur, it was inevitably of the scratch side variety, as neither single side could field six men. Hence more of the fundamental dualities of Morris made themselves evident: does this dance start on the right or left foot? Is it a foot up and up or a foot up and down? In Vandals of Hammerwich, does the sticking go right left partner partner or AAARGH THAT WAS MY KNUCKLE? (As a lesson for the future, Vandals is not a good scratch side dance, as every side but ours appears to do the chorus backwards. It would be tempting to say that this is a mistake you only make once, but my Logkeeper's notes indicate that we had done exactly the same at Mason's Apron's ale).  
After the event, Graham received some feedback that seemed to indicate again some fundamental ambivalence: the organisers were grateful enough to invite us to a celebratory dinner, but only on the condition that we refrain from actually dancing. 	


###15/09/2016 Negative ions conference###
**Introduction.** It has become customary to enrich scientific conferences with social and cultural activities, such as dinners<sup>1</sup> and visits to tourist attractions<sup>2</sup>. This is thought to foster interaction by increasing intermingling, randomising group composition and reducing inhibitions<sup>3</sup>. We explore here the effectiveness of a display of Morris dancing, a form of folk dancing of the English tradition<sup>4</sup>, for the entertainment of scientific delegates to a conference about Negative Ions<sup>5</sup> held in Oxford, UK.  
**Results.** A number of dances were performed in the Trinity College courtyard<sup>6</sup> by a roughly equal admixture of Oxford City Morris Men and Oxford University Morris Men, long-established local Morris sides of proven expertise<sup>7</sup>. The dancers were subsequently joined by an audience of conference delegates emerging from their social dinner, in which an unquantified amount of alcohol-containing beverages had been consumed<sup>8</sup>. Due to the outdoor location and specific astronomical arrangement of the event<sup>9</sup>, the performance took place in conditions of very limited visibility. Reception graded on a 5-point Likert scale<sup>10</sup> was deemed overall positive<sup>11</sup>, although definitive confirmation will rest upon the organisers' willingness to repeat the event in the future<sup>12</sup>. An unexpected observation was the gradual shifting of the set relative to the musicians. We speculate that the darkness may have limited the visual cues available to the dancers<sup>13</sup>, the Negative Ions may have exerted a lateral electromagnetic pull<sup>14</sup>, or the musicians may have covertly relocated mid-dance for comedic purposes<sup>15</sup>.  
**Conclusions.** We propose that our evidence supports the suitability of Morris dancing performances to entertain academics during social events. In order to replicate the successful results presented in this case study, we recommend that the variables are kept as close as possible to those hereby presented, namely 1) fairly intoxicated audiences and 2) barely visible dancers.

<sup>13</sup>: Unlikely, as we do the same in daylight.

<sup>15</sup>: Wouldn't put it past them. (Unless they put themselves past _it_ by covertly relocating mid-dance.)  


###27/08/2016 The wedding in Eynsham###
A lovely couple have decided to pledge their love and commitment to each other in front of their friend and loved ones, and throw a wonderful party in celebration of their life together. The bride would be delighted to entertain her guests with a lively display of traditional Morris dancing from a talented, professional local side. She leaves the arrangements far too late though, and she gets Oxford instead.  
To our credit, the couple version of Maid of the Mill (no lifting) is well received and we see ourselves off before the crowd is bored to tears. Fittingly, we are paid in beer only (foolish is the customer who thinks this is the cheap way out), competently and generously poured by the landlord of the Queens Head.  
Memorable events include: the 'Spoons refusing to serve beer to the (almost twice the legal age) Logkeeper; the single-prawn kebabs the boldest of us manage to snatch from the actual invited guests; the incredible downpour, which results in Stan being temporarily MIA (thought to be barricaded inside the toilets, but actually - and perhaps predictably - back at the beer tent); and the unbelievable occurrence of Mark Fry abandoning his concertina at the location and driving off with an empty box (the two were tearfully reunited the following Wednesday).


###25/06/2016 The Sandford Fete ###
First, you must know that we do not speak of the Sandford Fete. It is only referred to, in hints. That fete. The Fete worse than death. The word Sandford alone is usually enough to lower voices and avert eyes, and precipitate Duncan into a flurry of muttered apologies. Because, you see, he wasn't even there. Some woman called Sharon is at the root of it all, but it was Duncan who booked us, despite being away that weekend, and Duncan who got the money, and we just had to do what he told us, because he's the Bagman, you know? So there's 8 of us, Adrian and Mark for the music, and Ian, Graham, Keith, Big John, Jennifer and myself for dancing. We should have seen trouble coming when we got the confirmation email, on the day itself, and it said things like "one mile's walk once you get off the bus" and "we think it's at the recreation ground".  
We get on the bus, Jen and I, with the local elderlies staring at us suspiciously from behind their free bus passes. We get out under a downpour of Biblical proportions. So we walk the mile to the recreation ground, not signposted anywhere, because Sandford's the sort of place that's not even Google maps. It turns out, it's a bit optimistic to call it a ground - maybe swamp, or bog, or maybe quagmire. It's on a slope and still it manages to be all plump with rain, making all sorts of squeaking slurping noises under your heels. Around the mud field is this sad scattering of white plastic marquees - dry tasteless burgers, overpriced beer, a grim collection of houseplants. There's bunting hanging limp, a faded cardbord cutout of the Queen. Little Chinese-made plastic Union Jacks dangle from the hands of bored children. Dead-eyed young mothers push guerrilla prams the size of a medium car. We set up camp in the beer tent, and they charge us one pound for a half-litre bottle of water. Nobody dares to order a beer.  
So we're up for the first of our two stands. We make a move toward our assigned place at the centre of the slippery, sloping, waterlogged recreation ground. We can barely walk. We can't do Bledington because the hook legs would send us sprawling into the mud. We can't do Lichfield because there's not enough of us. We can't do Sherborne because we can't remember it. We can't do any stick dances where the sticks touch the ground because they would be sucked into the bog like the horse in the Neverending Story. Banbury Bill then. By the end we're panting, drenched in rain and sweat. It turns out even the mildest of dances is knackering if you need to tense all your muscles just to remain upright on the muddy incline. We decide that Dearest Dickie is a gentle enough dance and if we dance it very slowly it may get us to the end of the stand before any of us is swallowed by the Swamp of Sadness. We have to keep shifting the set at every chorus because each galley digs a little round pit in the mud and by the end of the dance the field looks like it's been overrun by moles in reverse. We make it through a couple more dances, heroically. Nobody is watching us.  
We get a break between our stands and hobble back to the beer tent. We must look pretty pathetic, because we get a free beer. We down it in dejected silence. We check the schedule: the local PowerHoop class is now due for their end-of-year demo. Now you know places like Sandford. If you work in the big city, getting home at 10 in the evening to a tiny bedsit to eat uncooked instant noodles out of the bag, you look at a place like Sandford and you think it's got everything you haven't got. A big house on a leafy terrace. An overpowered car or two, so you and your neighbours can bond over your shared environmental values. The well deserved and minimally compensated professional contribution of a cleaner, and a gardener, and the lady who does the laundry, and the expensive private tutor who will ensure that, ready or not, little Oliver will get into Oxford (the real Oxford, Oxford University, not Oxford City. Everybody knows you don't need a tutor to get into Oxford City. If it were possible to disqualify someone from Oxford City, that would do it). Sandford, you think, is where you go when you've won at the rat race of life. The final prize. You don't need to work anymore, not if you're a woman, because childcare costs more than you could earn anyway, you with your girl job. You can be a lady of leisure, pursue your many hobbies. You have a rich, creative soul in you that yearns for the time and freedom to unfurl. You can do whatever you want. So you do PowerHoop.  
A PowerHoop is a weighed hula hoop with bumps. You twirl it round to relentlessly looping fitness music and wave your arms about. You pay £6 a week for this privilege. It promises to slim your waist, because you twirl it round your waist, you see? If you want to target other problem areas you'll have to do like those circus performers who've got hoops around their legs and arms and neck and so on. It is a FUN, FUN, FUN!!! (direct quote from their Facebook) exercise that promises to take you down one dress size and foster a sense of sisterhood cemented by body shaming and competitive fitbitting. The PowerHoopers take the stage. This display attracts considerably more audience than ours.  
As we prepare for our second stand, Graham has to leave, the strategical bugger. That leaves us barely quorate. Our repertoire shrinks further to those dances which all six of us can dance and Adrian can play (we can't dance Pluck The Penguin or The Sailor's Sprocket, and he can't play That One That Goes Dee-Dim-Dee-Du-Dum And Then A Half Hey). We remain miraculously upright: most of the audience, disappointed, head off to splat the rat or get plastered. We dance well competently given the circumstances, propelled by little more than grim determination and the realisation that as long as we're dancing we don't have to suffer the actual fete. We make it to Bonny Green Garters. We manage to grab a couple of random children and a PowerHooper and secretly hope that they will slip ruinously and cry - especially the PowerHooper. She handles the dance with no difficulty and gives a cheerful toned-waist sneer to our invitation to come join a practice. The children do cry, but mostly out of a healthy terror. We repair to the beer tent while the worst Rolling Stones band to ever disgrace an amp set slaughters a collection of classics. Ian and Mark head off to the flower/classic car/taxidermied vole display. It's sudden-onset Stockholm syndrome, it must be. It is only the lack of bellowed instruments that saves them from joining the PowerHoop class and be lost forever, like that horse again. Jen and I have to walk an extra mile and a half in order to catch an earlier bus. We decide it's worth it. We have survived the Sandford fete, but it doesn't feel like a victory. It feels as if the mud is still sucking at our heels, the ground still slippery and unsound, our dance forever ignored and forgotten. The wind carries a jaunty rendition of Paint It Black, desperately out of tune.
